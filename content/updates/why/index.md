# Empty Pages

<div class="w-3/4 overflow-x-auto text-left">
  <div class="whitespace-pre">
{{< typeit 
  tag=h2
  speed=79
  initialString="Yo,<br>"
  speed=13
>}}
Empty or incomplete pages are likely, 

It is in my power to view a local version of the website without untimely publishing it. 

But
{{< /typeit >}}</div>
  </div>
