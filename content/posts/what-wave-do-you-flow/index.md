# Uh
Thermodynamic equilibrium
Entropy
Micro-state

Masculine vs. Feminine Goals. Horikita, Way of the House Husband
M Strives for achievement
F Strives for social longing

Boltzzman Constant

PV = NkT / PV = nRT + variations. Ideal Gas Laws.

Particle establishes AND focuses on its unique direction, indicating improvement
Waves have predefined troughs / peaks, amplitudes, frequencies, etc. 
  - Negative / Positive emotions, Intensity of NP emotions, rate of NP emotions, etc.
Waves mimicking particles = Horikita
  - Wave / Particle mimicking intrinsically disadvantegous 
Particles mimicking waves = Gay
Particles making autonomous waves as a byproduct while maintaining a particle state = Badass
Giving advice is best to the man who gives it + Giving advice --> Conveying a phantom wave for others to re/construct for their own, autonomous wave
Wave's job is for particle to maintain direction (center line), finding the proper wave = important && not exclusive to "soul mates."
  - From the day we were born, we gain maternal / parental wave to maintain direction of maturity during growth
  - Destructive waves can emasculate the particle, reassigning its properties (weight, contents, mass) which the most important one is being direction
    - Smoking, drinking, bad habits
    - Bad friends

Constructive interference when combined waves vs. energy transfer when particles bump/combine
  - Spotting in gym
